# MyOrthotics 2.0 Workshop


MyOrthotics 2.0 is a new version of the Fab Academy final project (MyOrthotics), developed by Adriana Cabrera in 2016 for cases of semi paralysis.

This version is based on cutting and its purpose is to explore rapid construction for orthotics for first aid cases or temporary use.
The first version of this orthotic workshop was realized in the Fab Lab Kamp-Lintfort Hochschule Rhein Waal for the course of Biomechanics and Biomaterial and for the class of Prof. William Megill. 


The changes of the microcontroller board were designed for the workshop Hands on assistive devices (MyOrthotics 2.0) realized in the international Fab Lab Conference in Santiago de Chile. 


In the repository you can find the template of the splint for men and women to introduction of the topic. For optimal fitting, 3D scanning the patient's arm and hand is recommended.
